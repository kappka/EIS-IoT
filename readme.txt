This prototype is an automatic plant watering system powered by Arduino. It works by reading data from soil moisture, temperature, and humidity sensors. If the soil is too dry, the temperature is high, or the air is too dry, the water pump turns on to irrigate the plant. If rain is detected, the pump stays off. All readings, such as temperature and soil moisture level, are displayed on an LCD screen. A green LED lights up when conditions are normal, while a red LED and a buzzer are activated when the plant needs water. This system helps automate plant watering based on real-time environmental conditions.
